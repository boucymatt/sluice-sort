/* ==========================================================================
 * Sluice — an adaptive numeric sorting engine that routes every dataset
 * through its fastest available sorting strategy.
 *
 * Author: Alphanu1 / Ben Templaman
 * Since:  2026-07-08
 *
 * A "sluice" channels a mixed stream and separates it into graded outputs by
 * routing it through the right screen. This engine does the same: it inspects
 * the input and dispatches to the fastest applicable method —
 *
 *     tiny arrays (n<16)    -> insertion sort      (no setup cost)
 *     small arrays (n<=512) -> interpolation place  (branch-light; ~2-5x; skew-guarded)
 *     already sorted        -> return early         (detected in the scan pass)
 *     descending run        -> reverse in place     (detected in the scan pass)
 *     bounded range         -> counting sort        (O(n), no comparisons)
 *     few distinct values   -> low-cardinality tally (<=16 distinct, no heap)
 *     dominant values+noise -> heavy-hitter partition (duplicate-heavy w/ outliers)
 *     wide keys (64-bit)    -> MSD radix, early-exit  (stops when buckets split)
 *     everything else       -> LSD radix sort        (O(n·w), beats std::sort)
 *     allocation fails      -> std::sort             (in-place safety net)
 *
 * so it is never meaningfully slower than std::sort and often several times
 * faster. Non-comparison methods sidestep the Ω(n·log n) comparison bound.
 *
 * This header exposes a stable C ABI so the shared library is callable from
 * C, C++, Python (ctypes/cffi), Rust, Go, etc.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Thread safety
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every function is reentrant and holds no shared mutable state — there are no
 * globals, no statics, no hidden caches. Concurrent calls are safe as long as
 * they operate on non-overlapping arrays; two threads sorting the same buffer
 * is a data race, exactly as it would be for memcpy. sluice_version() returns a
 * pointer to a string literal with static storage duration (safe to share).
 * Passing max_threads > 1 in sluice_config lets a single call use an internal
 * thread pool for large radix sorts; that parallelism is confined to the call
 * and does not change the reentrancy guarantee above.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Behavior under allocation failure
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The engine never aborts or leaks when the system is out of memory. Every
 * heap-using path allocates inside a guard; on std::bad_alloc it retreats to
 * the next cheaper path and, ultimately, to an in-place std::sort over the
 * order-preserving key (which needs no heap and keeps a correct total order for
 * every domain, including IEEE-754 NaNs). The array is always left fully
 * sorted, no exception crosses the ABI boundary, and the status-returning
 * sluice_sort() still reports SLUICE_OK (with stats.algorithm == "std::sort"
 * and stats.memory_bytes == 0 when the fallback ran). Verified by
 * tests/alloc_fault.cpp (make alloc-test), which injects failures into every
 * allocation and checks the result under ASan+UBSan.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * C ABI compatibility policy
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The library uses semantic versioning (see sluice_version). While the version
 * is 0.x the ABI is not yet frozen and may change between minor versions. From
 * 1.0.0 onward the following are contractual within a major version:
 *   - Existing exported function signatures do not change.
 *   - sluice_status / sluice_dtype / sluice_order enumerator values are stable;
 *     new enumerators may be appended but existing ones keep their values.
 *   - New fields are only ever appended to the end of sluice_config and
 *     sluice_stats. Callers must zero-initialize these structs (e.g.
 *     `sluice_config c = {0};` or sluice_config_init) so that fields added
 *     later default to zero; the library treats a zeroed field as "default".
 *   - New functionality is added as new functions, not by repurposing existing
 *     ones. Breaking changes are reserved for a new major version.
